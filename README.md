# Code Challenge â€“ Back-End Software Developer @ TUI 

Here you would find the solution to the coding challenge.

## How to execute

1. In the same way as in the instructions provided, run the following commands under `./code` folder

`gradlew clean build`<br/>`gradlew docker`

2. Then, from the deployment directory:

`docker-compose up -d`

## How to test

### Manual testing with postman

I've included an updated postman collection under `./code` folder. On there you will be able to test the behaviour of the different endpoints.

### Performance testing with JMeter

On the root folder, there's a `.jmx` file that includes some tests that can be imported into JMeter, to check if the non functional requirements are met.
